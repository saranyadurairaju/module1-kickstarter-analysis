# Kickstarting with Excel

The ability to consolidate data points, analyze data and create a cohesive narrative is the ultimate goal of any data analysis. Excel helps us to do these with formulas, slicers and pivot charts. With all these we can aggregate data to create a meaningful reports. 

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s is a playwrighter who wants to do a fundraising project campaign "Fever". She has a crowd funding data which we have to organize, sort and analyse to make her project successful.

### Purpose

The Kickstarter data involved in this project has different category, country, goals, backer and dates which decides the outcome(Successful, failed or canceled) of it. So, the purpose of this data analysis is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

Analysis:

1) There are more category and items involved in this data, so we need to first filter the data and understand each category.

2) Need to find the Average and percentage amounts to analyze the data properly.

3) The timestamps are not readable, so we have to use the formula to convert it to readable format. 

4) Excel Document "Kickstarter_Challenge" in the below link has all the converted and modified data in the "Kickstarter" sheet. 

Challenges:
 
Even after categorised the data and try to analyze, its very difficult to come to conclusion as the data is not in a much visualized format. So, we need to use Pivot and other formulas to have visualization of data specific to certain categories.
 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

1) Using a pivot table, we are comparing the outcomes based on every month as the date plays a important role in campaign. 

2) We are slicing the data based on Parent Category and Years to find which category will give more success for Louise.

3) With this data, we are using Line chart to compare and visualize the outcomes (successful, failed and canceled).

4) Excel Document "Kickstarter_Challenge" given above has "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" sheet which has the Pivot table and chart.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

1) For every project "Goal amount" is the main parameter which decides the Success of it.

2) So we need to find the Percentage of outcomes for different range of Goal amounts.

3) We can easily compare the percentage of Outcomes in the Goal range with the Line chart.

4) Excel Document "Kickstarter_Challenge" given above has "Outcomes based on Goals" sheet which has the table and chart for comparison.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

1) Finding which data to compare or analyze is the difficult part of it. But understading the project and visualizing the data properly helps us overcome from this challenge.

2) Using the right formulas and charts is little challenging. 

## Results

- The Outcomes based on Launch Date

Theater category has more successful Outcomes and Total Projects
Also it has more successful projects in the month of May

- The Outcomes based on Goals

when the goal amount is between 1000 and 5000 it has more successful ratio

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
whic
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

country and category based comparison
