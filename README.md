# Kickstarting with Excel

The ability to consolidate data points, analyze data and create a cohesive narrative is the ultimate goal of any data analysis. Excel helps us to do these with formulas, slicers and pivot charts. With all these we can aggregate data to create a meaningful reports. 

## Overview of Project

Louiseâ€™s is a playwrighter who wants to do a fundraising project campaign "Fever". She has a crowd funding data which we have to organize, sort and analyse to make her project successful.

### Purpose

The Kickstarter data involved in this project has different category, country, goals, backer and dates which decides the outcome(Successful, failed or canceled) of it. So, the purpose of this data analysis is to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

As there are more category and items involved, we can apply filter for better understanding. Also the Average and Percentage amounts can be calculated from Goal and Pledge amounts to analyze the data properly. Since the timestamps are not readable, it can be converted by using formula. 

Excel Document "Kickstarter_Challenge" in the below link has all the converted and modified data in the "Kickstarter" sheet.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

However we catagorize the data, its difficult to come for a conclusion without visualization. So, we need to use Pivot and other Formulas to have this visualization is needed.

* Using a pivot table, we are comparing the outcomes based on every month as the date plays a important role in campaign. 

* We are slicing the data based on Parent Category and Years to find which category will give more success for Louise.

* With this data, we are using Line chart to compare and visualize the outcomes (successful, failed and canceled).

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* For every project "Goal amount" is the main parameter which decides the Success of it.

* So we need to find the Percentage of outcomes for different range of Goal amounts.

* We can easily compare the percentage of Outcomes in the Goal range with the Line chart.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

1) Finding which data to compare or analyze is the difficult part of it. But understading the project and visualizing the data properly helps us overcome from this challenge.

2) Using the right formulas and charts is little challenging. 

## Results

- The Outcomes based on Launch Date

Theater category has more successful Outcomes and Total Projects
Also it has more successful projects in the month of May

- The Outcomes based on Goals

when the goal amount is between 1000 and 5000 it has more successful ratio

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
whic
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

country and category based comparison
